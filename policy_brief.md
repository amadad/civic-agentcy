# Policy Brief: Ranked Choice Voting (RCV)

## Executive Summary

Ranked Choice Voting (RCV), also known as Instant Runoff Voting, is an electoral system where voters rank candidates in order of preference. This system ensures that a candidate wins with a majority rather than a simple plurality, potentially providing a better representation of public sentiment. While RCV has its advantages such as encouraging positive campaigning and minimizing the spoiler effect, it also has some disadvantages including complexity and cost considerations.

## Introduction

RCV is a growing trend in electoral systems worldwide. It is designed to better capture public sentiment and promote majoritarian outcomes. As of late February 2024, RCV has been implemented in various cities across the United States and in several countries globally.

## Analysis of the Issue

While the traditional voting system allows voters to choose only one candidate, RCV allows voters to rank candidates in order of preference. If no candidate wins a clear majority in the initial count, the lowest performing candidate(s) are removed, and those voters' subsequent choices are considered. This process continues until a candidate achieves a winning threshold, typically over 50%.

Advantages of RCV include more accurately reflecting voters' preferences, encouraging positive campaigning, minimizing the spoiler effect, and promoting outcomes that require a true majority. However, there are also disadvantages such as the complexity of understanding and implementing RCV, the possibility of confusion among voters, cost considerations, and strategic challenges.

## Proposed Solutions

To address the disadvantages of RCV, it is important to provide adequate resources for voter education and necessary infrastructure modifications. Efforts should be made to simplify the process and reduce confusion, while also addressing strategic challenges.

## Conclusion

RCV is a progressive step towards creating a more representative and inclusive electoral system. Despite the challenges, its implementation could lead to more accurate representation of public sentiment, thus strengthening our democratic process. As such, it is recommended that policy makers consider the adoption of RCV in their jurisdictions, with the appropriate measures in place to mitigate its disadvantages.
